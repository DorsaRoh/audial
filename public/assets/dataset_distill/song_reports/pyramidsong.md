## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: complex, evolving, jazz-influenced
- **bass role**: absent (piano-driven)
- **motif**: piano chord progression with voicing, melody in triangle
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds through addition

## what makes this work

- **piano voicing**: chord voicing creates rich harmonic texture
- **melodic layer**: triangle melody adds counterpoint
- **drum evolution**: drums vary per section, creating energy changes
- **section structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections

## what would break it

- making sections too similar would lose contrast
- removing melodic layer would sound static
- making drums too busy would compete with piano

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **piano voicing**: using piano with voicing creates rich harmonic texture
- **melodic counterpoint**: adding melody to harmony creates interest

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: chord_progression_voicing (piano voicing creates harmony)
- **secondary**: section_based_arrangement (sections via pickRestart), melodic_motif_variation (triangle melody)

## justification

this song uses chord_progression_voicing as primary (piano voicing creates harmony). section_based_arrangement creates structure (sections via pickRestart). melodic_motif_variation adds melody (triangle counterpoint). the combination creates a jazz-influenced, evolving texture.
