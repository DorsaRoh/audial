## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: complex, polyrhythmic, world music feel
- **bass role**: absent (harmony-driven)
- **motif**: chord progression with multiple voicing layers, melody in marimba/trombone
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds through layer addition

## what makes this work

- **textural layering**: multiple percussion layers (shaker, clave, bongo, etc.) create rich texture
- **voicing layers**: guitar + strings create harmonic texture
- **melodic layers**: marimba and trombone add melody without dominating
- **section structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections with different combinations

## what would break it

- making layers too similar would sound muddy
- removing melodic layers would sound static
- making percussion too busy would compete with harmony

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **textural layering**: multiple simple layers create rich composite texture
- **world percussion**: using diverse percussion samples creates timbral interest

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: textural_layering (multiple layers create texture)
- **secondary**: section_based_arrangement (sections via pickRestart), chord_progression_voicing (harmony foundation)

## justification

this song is a clear example of textural_layering (multiple percussion and harmony layers create rich texture). section_based_arrangement creates structure (sections via pickRestart). chord_progression_voicing provides harmonic foundation. the combination creates a world music, polyrhythmic feel.
