## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: rock, 4/4, syncopated, builds energy
- **bass role**: syncopated pattern, drives rhythm, varies per section
- **motif**: guitar patterns, vary per section
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds energy

## what makes this work

- **section structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections (intro, verse, chorus)
- **guitar layering**: lead and rhythm guitar create texture
- **syncopated bass**: bass pattern creates groove
- **drum evolution**: drums vary per section, creating energy changes

## what would break it

- making sections too similar would lose contrast
- removing guitar layers would sound thin
- making bass pattern too simple would lose groove

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **guitar layering**: multiple guitar layers create rock texture
- **section structure**: pickRestart creates song form

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: section_based_arrangement (sections via pickRestart)
- **secondary**: bass_driven_groove (syncopated bass drives rhythm), drum_pattern_variation (drums vary per section)

## justification

this song uses section_based_arrangement as primary (sections via pickRestart). bass_driven_groove creates rhythm (syncopated bass). drum_pattern_variation adds rhythmic interest (drums vary). the combination creates a complete rock song structure.
