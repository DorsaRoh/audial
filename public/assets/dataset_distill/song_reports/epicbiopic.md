## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: complex, evolving drum patterns, orchestral feel
- **bass role**: absent (harmony-driven)
- **motif**: chord progression with multiple voicing layers, melody in tuba
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds through layer addition

## what makes this work

- **section-based structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i)
- **layered voicing**: multiple chord layers (supersaw, triangle, square) create rich texture
- **melodic layer**: tuba melody adds counterpoint to harmony
- **drum evolution**: drums vary per section, creating energy changes

## what would break it

- making sections too similar would lose contrast
- removing melodic layer would sound static
- making drums too busy would compete with harmony

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **section-based arrangement**: using pickRestart to create distinct sections
- **layered voicing**: multiple chord layers create orchestral texture

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: section_based_arrangement (distinct sections via pickRestart)
- **secondary**: textural_layering (multiple harmony layers create texture)

## justification

this song is a clear example of section_based_arrangement (multiple sections via pickRestart). textural_layering creates rich harmonic texture through multiple voicing layers. the combination creates an orchestral, cinematic feel.
