## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: steady, arpeggiated, minimal
- **bass role**: absent (arpeggio-driven)
- **motif**: arpeggiated pattern, varies via pick()
- **form/arc**: single section, arp pattern varies (static)

## what makes this work

- **arpeggiated texture**: arp pattern creates harmonic motion
- **pattern variation**: `.pick()` creates variation in arp pattern
- **chord progression**: chord sequence drives harmony
- **minimal texture**: single layer creates focus

## what would break it

- making arp pattern too complex would sound busy
- removing chord progression would lose harmonic foundation
- adding more layers would lose minimalism

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **arpeggiated texture**: arp patterns create harmonic motion
- **pattern variation**: using `.pick()` to vary patterns creates interest

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: arpeggiated_chord (chord broken into arpeggio pattern)
- **secondary**: none (this is a pure arp piece)

## justification

this song is a textbook example of arpeggiated_chord: chord progression broken into arpeggiated pattern. the `.pick()` method creates variation in the arp pattern. the combination creates a minimal, harmonic texture.
