## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: electronic, 4/4, syncopated, builds energy
- **bass role**: syncopated pattern, drives rhythm, varies per section
- **motif**: lead synth pattern, varies per section
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds energy, uses delay/reverb

## what makes this work

- **section structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections with different patterns
- **syncopated bass**: bass pattern creates groove
- **delay/reverb**: effects create space and movement
- **layer addition**: sections add layers (drums, lead) creating build

## what would break it

- making sections too similar would lose contrast
- removing delay/reverb would sound dry
- making bass pattern too simple would lose groove

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **pickRestart for sections**: using pickRestart to create distinct sections
- **delay for movement**: delay creates rhythmic interest and space

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: section_based_arrangement (sections via pickRestart)
- **secondary**: bass_driven_groove (syncopated bass drives rhythm), drum_pattern_variation (drums vary per section), dynamic_build_release (sections build energy)

## justification

this song uses section_based_arrangement as primary (sections via pickRestart). bass_driven_groove creates rhythm (syncopated bass). drum_pattern_variation adds rhythmic interest (drums vary). dynamic_build_release creates energy curve (sections build). the combination creates a complete electronic dance track.
