## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: complex, evolving, section-based
- **bass role**: syncopated pattern, drives rhythm, varies per section
- **motif**: melodic pattern in oboe, varies per section
- **form/arc**: multiple sections via pickRestart, builds energy, uses arrange() for structure

## what makes this work

- **section structure**: pickRestart creates distinct sections (verse, chorus, interlude)
- **chord progression**: chord sequence drives harmony
- **layer addition**: sections add layers (bass, guitar, organ) creating build
- **drum evolution**: drums vary per section, creating energy changes

## what would break it

- making sections too similar would lose contrast
- removing chord progression would lose harmonic foundation
- making drums too busy would compete with melody

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **section structure**: pickRestart creates song form
- **chord-driven harmony**: chord progression drives all layers

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: section_based_arrangement (sections via pickRestart)
- **secondary**: chord_progression_voicing (chord progression drives harmony), bass_driven_groove (syncopated bass drives rhythm), drum_pattern_variation (drums vary per section)

## justification

this song uses section_based_arrangement as primary (sections via pickRestart). chord_progression_voicing provides harmonic foundation. bass_driven_groove creates rhythm (syncopated bass). drum_pattern_variation adds rhythmic interest (drums vary). the combination creates a complete song structure.
