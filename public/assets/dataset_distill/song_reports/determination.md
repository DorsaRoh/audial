# determination

## brief structural analysis

- **groove**: steady pulse from bass and harmony, no explicit drums
- **bass role**: root-based pattern, changes every 2-4 beats, drives harmonic motion
- **motif**: lead melody has clear phrases that repeat and vary (e.g., `[F#5 F5 D#5 C#5 D#5 A#4 C5 ~]`)
- **form/arc**: multiple sections, builds through addition of harmony layer, then adds bass variation

## what makes this work

- **melodic phrases**: clear 4-8 note phrases that repeat with transposition/variation
- **layered entry**: lead enters first, then harmony, then bass (creates build)
- **harmonic support**: harmony layer provides context for melody without being melodic itself
- **bass variation**: bass pattern changes in later sections (walking bass style)

## what would break it

- making melody too random would lose coherence
- removing harmony would make melody sound thin
- making bass too busy would compete with melody

## extracted reusable idea(s)

- **phrase-based melody**: defining clear melodic phrases that repeat/vary creates coherence
- **layered entry**: introducing layers sequentially creates narrative arc

## recommended strategies

- **primary**: melodic_motif_variation (clear phrases that repeat and vary)
- **secondary**: harmonic_motion_bass (bass drives harmony, varies over time)

## justification

this song is a clear example of melodic_motif_variation: the lead has distinct phrases that repeat with transposition and variation. the bass functions as harmonic_motion_bass (drives harmony, varies in later sections). the layered entry creates a dynamic_build_release effect.
